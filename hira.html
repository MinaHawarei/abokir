            Boys of Male and Female Students, Institute Family of Masters Faculty and Administrators
            "Read" is the word that marked a tremendous shift in science and knowledge for humanity as a whole, by which knowledge was transferred, science was codified, civilizations were built, and we live in a new world governed by science and knowledge. A new world of educated, trained and effective human resources.
            Through the Institute's website, you can read and listen to my dear students from faculty, and you can learn about the school plan, our main and specific departments, the school schedules, the examination schedules, the outcome of each semester, student activities, the activities of the training unit, the graduates, all the educational process and academic decisions...
            Since in Egypt we have great youth energy, the strength of our society from the strength of our youth to teach and train it in the mechanisms and fundamentals of the times depends very much on the extent to which we are able to upgrade this young human power and provide them with the opportunity for effective education.The outstanding training that qualifies them for contemporary working life depends very much on how much we can increase his self-confidence and give him hope for the future.
            We are therefore keen on the continuous development of curricula, various learning methods, scientific and practical activities in tourism, hotels and antiquities, making Abu Qir a highly qualified graduate of the labour market in Egypt and abroad.
            Thus, the Institute's mission was to sow the seeds for the upgrading of the educational process and the development of skills, hoping to see them grow and flourish.
